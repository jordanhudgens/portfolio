            <h2>BeerFlash iOS App</h2>
            <h2>mobile application development</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In the Fall of 2014 I was given the task of building out a consumer photo and location sharing application by the BeerFlash management team and investors. This startup is focused on enabling beer enthusiasts from around the world to share their experiences with others and discover friends with common interests.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>With having the requirement to offer both social networking features with geo-specific targeting, this project offered several unique challenges due to the fact that it needed to be a hybrid application, giving users a feed based on both the users they follow and their own dynamic location. I built the system out from scratch and delivered an app that met all the requested requirements.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to meeting the requirements, the I also went above and beyond the list of requirements and incorporated a photo filtering process so users were able to apply styles to their photos.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, I also created all of the logo and branding items for the application and company itself.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The project followed mobile development best practices, including following agile methodology, version control and unit testing</p>

            <h2>What the client had to say</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>"Jordan worked with my partners and I to build and publish an app on the iTunes Store. We have zero knowledge of coding but we had an idea and a vision for how we thought the app should work. Jordan met with us and then presented an idea and timeline and has continued to meet with us as the app is developed and we have nothing but good things to say about the experience."</p>
